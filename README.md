# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  # In this project, I developed a modern To-Do List application using React and Vite. I built the project with the following features:

-> State Management: Managed the state of tasks using the useState hook.

-> Components: Structured the application into various components to make it modular and reusable.

-> Form Handling: Created a form to add new tasks and managed the form submission.

-> Toggle Functionality: Implemented the toggleTodo function to change the completion status of tasks.

-> Delete Functionality: Added the deleteTodo function to remove tasks.

-> Persistent State: Used localStorage to persist tasks even when the browser is closed (with the useEffect hook).

-> Styling: Designed the user interface using CSS, styling elements such as buttons and forms. Leveraged React's core features and Vite's fast development environment.
